# Fault-Localization-Using-Genetic-Algorithm
This is a Fault Localization with a Genetic Algorithm Project that is used to automatically identify faulty components in a program by applying the principles of evolution. Improves the speed and efficiency of debugging and localize bugs in large codebases.
It aims to reduce debugging time by accurately identifying faulty chromosomes. 
It includes techniques such as program slicing, spectrum-based fault localization and machine learning-based approaches.
