# Fault-Localization-Using-Genetic-Algorithm
This is a Fault Localization with a Genetic Algorithm project that is used to automatically identify faulty components in a program by applying the principles of evolution. Improves the speed and efficiency of debugging and localize bugs in large codebases.
